        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I work as a programmer in a state organization and strive to expand my skills in webdevelopment.</p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in front-end and related technologies: Javascript, HTML&CSS, web design and
            back-end a bit (PHP, NodeJS).
            Before I got a job as a programmer, I was engaged in freelancing for almost five years. Now I'm trying to
            get a deep knowledge of JavaScript and skills for the teamwork.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>The main programming language is Javascript. I have a solid body of practical knowledge: how to make a modal
            window, how to check the feedback form, how to make a menu, etc.</p>
        <p>
            I have a good experience of the JQuery framework. Worked with many jQuery plugins.</p>
        <p>In addition, I have been working with CMS platforms for quite a long time. The most favorite of them is
            Wordpress. I understand PHP code, I have experience in building SQL queries.</p>
        <p>The knowledge and skills base that allowed me to engage in webdevelopment, I received during training as a
            web-programmer at IBMT BSU.</p>
        <p>In this educational institution, we were taught not only the basics of programming, but also working with
            graphics. In the course of training, I mastered such programs as Notepad++, Atom, PHPStorm, Visual Studio Code, Photoshop, Corel, 3DS Max, Adobe Animate.</p>
        <h2>Code Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Replacing styles based on date attributes (JS)</li>
            <li>Class for form validation, calculating the cost of services and sending to the server (ASP, JS, Ajax)</li>
            <li>Sending a form with an attachment (ASP, JS, Ajax)</li>
            <li>Solving tasks on Codewars:

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I presented my first project in 2015 during the defense of my diploma project. This work included creating a website
