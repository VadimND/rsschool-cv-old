        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I work as a programmer in a government Agency and strive to expand my skills in web development.</p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in frontend and related technologies: Javascript, HTML&CSS, web design and
            interface design.
            Before I got a job as a programmer, I was engaged in freelancing for almost five years. Now I'm trying to
            get a deep knowledge of JavaScript and teamwork.</p>
        <p>I have my own website: <a href="https://webzorka.by" target="_blank">https://webzorka.by</a>.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>The main programming language is Javascript. I have a solid body of practical knowledge: how to make a modal
            window, how to check the feedback form, how to make a menu, etc.</p>
        <p>
            I have a Good command of the JQuery framework. Worked with many jQuery plugins.</p>
        <p>In addition, I have been working with CMS platforms for quite a long time. The most favorite of them is
            Wordpress.
            I understand PHP code, I have experience in building SQL queries.</p>
        <p>The knowledge and skills base that allowed me to engage in web development, I received during training as a
            web programmer at IBMT BSU.</p>
        <p>In this educational institution, we were taught not only the basics of programming, but also working with
            graphics.
            In the course of training, I mastered such programs as Photoshop, Corel, 3DS Max, Adobe Animate.</p>
        <h2>Code Examples</h2>

        </ul>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I presented my first project in 2015 during the defense of my thesis. This work included creating a website
            from scratch for a beauty Studio. As a result, I successfully defended my work. After studying at the
            Institute, I also have a lot of practical work related to creating web pages.</p>
        <p>I have created several websites that are still working. In addition to creating, I also support several
            online projects. My current job is related to website development. I am creating a website for a large state
            library.</p>
