## Summary
My full name is Vadim Dyshlevich.
I work as a programmer in a government Agency and strive to expand my skills in webdevelopment.  
I am particularly interested in front-end and related technologies: Javascript, HTML&CSS, web design and back-end a bit (PHP, NodeJS). 
Before I got a job as a programmer, I was engaged in freelancing for almost five years. Now I'm trying to get a deep knowledge of JavaScript and teamwork.

### Prefill an Array
```
function prefill(n, v) {  
    if (isNaN(n)) {
        throw new TypeError(n + " is invalid");
    }
    if (n === Infinity || n === -Infinity) {
        throw new TypeError(n + " is invalid");
    }
    if (n < 0) {
        throw new TypeError(n + " is invalid");
    }
    if (typeof n === 'boolean') {
        throw new TypeError(n + " is invalid");
    }
    if (!isNaN(n) && n.toString().indexOf('.') != -1) {
        throw new TypeError(n + " is invalid");
    }
    let arr = [];
    
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr.push(v);
    }                            
    return arr;                           
    
}
``` 
### Count words
```
function countWords(str) {  
    let res; 
    let arr = [];
    if(str !== "" && !str.includes(" ") && !str.includes("")) {    
        res = 1;
    }
    if(str !== "" && !str.includes(" ") && str.includes("")) {    
        res = 0;
    }
    if(str !== "" && str.includes(" ")) {
        res = str.trim().split(" ");
        for (let i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
            if (res[i] !== "") {
                arr.push(res[i]);
            }
        }
        res = arr.length;
    }      
    if(str === "" || str === "") {
        res = 0;
    } 
    if (str.indexOf("") === 0 && str.includes(" ")) {
        str = str.replace(str.charAt(0), "")
        res = str.match(//g).length + 1;
    }   
    if (str.indexOf("") > 0 ) {
        res = str.match(//g).length + 1;
    }                           
    return res;  
}
``` 
## Experience 
I presented my first project in 2015 during the defense of my thesis. This work included creating a website from scratch for a beauty Studio. As a result, I successfully defended my work. After studying at the Institute, I also have a lot of practical work related to creating web pages.  
I have created several websites that are still working. In addition to creating, I also support several online projects. My current job is related to website development. I am creating a website for a large state library.
